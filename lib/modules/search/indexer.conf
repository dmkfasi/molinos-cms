# Document sections.
#
# Format is:
#
#   Section <string> <number> <maxlen> [clone] [sep] [{expr} {repl}]
#
# where <string> is a section name and <number> is section ID
# between 0 and 255. Use 0 if you don't want to index some of 
# these sections. It is better to use different sections IDs
# for different documents parts. In this case during search 
# time you'll be able to give different weight to each part
# or even disallow some sections at a search time.
# <maxlen> argument contains a maximum length of section
# which will be stored in database.
# "clone" is an optional parameter describing whether this
# section should affect clone detection. It can 
# be "DetectClone" or "cdon", or "NoDetectClone" or "cdoff".
# By default, url.* section values are not taken in account
# for clone detection, while any other sections take part
# in clone detection.
# "sep" is an optional argument to specify a separator between
# parts of the same section. It is a space character by default.
# "expr" and "repl" can be used to extract user defined sections,
# for example pieces of text between the given tags. "expr" is
# a regular expression, "repl" is a replacement with $1, $2, etc
# meta-characters designating matches "expr" matches.

# Don't forget to keep "Charset" section active if you use cached copies.
# NOTE: 3.2.18 has limits for CachedCopy size, 32000 for Ibase and
# 15000 for Mimer. Other databases do not have limits.
# If indexer fails with 'string too long' error message then reduce
# this number. This will be fixed in the future versions.
